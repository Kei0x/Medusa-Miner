# Medusa Miner


A dumb, miner implementation for a dumb, centralized blockchain I made which resets if a block isn't found within a target time. Difficulty can be changed.

I will open source the blockchain itself after I refactor it and clean it..

and the other hilarious jokes you can tell yourself as a developer.


## Setup



Don't. It's not worth it.



## Why?

PS: If you can't understand what's being said then it's probably for the better.
